# Simulation of a Water Park Ride Operation
## Yahlly Schein

### Project Overview
This project simulates the operation of a water park ride with two slides using discrete-event simulation techniques

This is a simulation of a real-world problem, modeling visitor behavior, ride operations, queue management, and staff management throughout a typical day at the water park, based on the specific requirements detailed in the assignment. 
The simulation provided insights into the operational dynamics and helped identify potential improvements.
